This class occurs in two parts -- Soldering and Programming.

We'll be soldering parts and headers  onto a custom printed circuit board(PCB).  
This board is a copy of the [Adafruit Feather nrf52840 express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062).  

When you connect from USB to your computer it shows up as an external hard drive with pre-loaded example scripts.
